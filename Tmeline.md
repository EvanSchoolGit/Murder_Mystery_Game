## ENDINGS

### Arrest Oliver
DRAFT
Oliver is sentenced. No one is upset that he died, but rather underwhelmed that a murderer would kill someone with no motive, and then admit guilt. However, niche online forums began a conspiracy of Oliver being 'framed' or a 'martyr'. No one took these seriously, and you were praised by your boss for a job well done.

### Arrest Lucas
DRAFT
Lucas is senetenced, with public outcry, you were given unpaid leave, which is the second harshest punishment you can be given on the force.

If Lucas's secerets were revealed, the public would lambast Lucas as a terrible human, you are given a 3 cents raise. Don't spend it all on one place!

### Arrest Vixen
DRAFT
Vixen is sentenced, no one is upset with the ruling, but rather upset with how Vixen was placed in this poor situation. She'd be an example of unfortunate circumstance for years to come, and eventually had a charity orginization named after her with a mixed reputation. You were reprimanded by your boss, and now have tinnitus! 

### Arrest Wilson
DRAFT
Wilson is sentenced, the public thinks of it as a hilarious incident, mocking both you and Wilson for this blunder. You were eventually executed by your policing firm for making this mistake.

if you found all of the evidence and sentenced Wilson, you have a small pride, doing so.
